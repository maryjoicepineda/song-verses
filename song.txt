Honey, honey, how you thrill me, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, nearly kill me, aha, honey honey
I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine
Oh, you make me dizzy

Honey, honey, let me feel it, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, don't conceal it, aha, honey honey
The way that you kiss goodnight
(The way that you kiss me goodnight)
The way that you hold me tight
(The way that you're holding me tight)
I feel like I wanna sing when you do your thing

Honey, honey, touch me, baby, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, hold me, baby, aha, honey honey
You look like a movie star
(You look like a movie star)
But I know just who you are
(I know just who you are)
And, honey, to say the least, you're a dog-gone beast
